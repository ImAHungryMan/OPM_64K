            description = Due to its distance from Kerbin, it wasn't until fairly recently that Kerbalkind discovered the Kerbol system's most distant planet. At first scientists thought Neidon might a purple, rocky planet like Eve, but they quickly realized they were in fact looking at an ice giant similar to Urlum.

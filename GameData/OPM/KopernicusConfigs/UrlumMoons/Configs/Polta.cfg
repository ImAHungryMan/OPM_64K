			description = Polta's mint-colored appearance immediately reminded astronomers of Minmus, but it was quickly realized that that was still in orbit of Kerbin and this thus had to be another body. Polta's surface is made of smooth and swirling terrain forms, most likely a result of tidal heating caused by the nearby Urlum.

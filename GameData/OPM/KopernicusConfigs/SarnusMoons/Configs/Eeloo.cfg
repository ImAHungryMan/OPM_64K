			description = Discovered at the same time as Plock, the square heads in charge of cataloging the astronomical discoveries mixed up the records of two celestial bodies, leading to years of one being confused for the other. The surface of Eeloo is covered in brown scratches, which could be the result of cryovolcanic activity. This might mean that the moons harbors a liquid ocean beneath its frozen crust.
